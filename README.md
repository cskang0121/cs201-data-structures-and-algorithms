## CS201 Data Structures And Algorithms

This repository contains my solutions for an introductory course in data structures and algorithms. The course builds on students’ earlier programming experiences, moving beyond syntax and logic, to the question of how to build “better” programs focusing on organizing data and designing algorithms for efficiency. The materials as well as the assignments rely heavily on proficiency with Java programming language.

#### Course Outline:

• The concept of efficiency, why it is important for programs to be efficient and scalable, how
to manage the trade-offs of computational time as well as resources such as memory, and
how to compare the efficiency of various algorithms.

• Problem-solving through judicious organization of data, how abstract data types allow
encapsulation and localization, as well as how their concrete implementations in the form of various data structures allow for efficient access and modification of data.

• Algorithmic strategies such as divide-and-conquer, iteration, recursion, randomization, etc., to achieve more effective problem solving and more efficient solutions.

This course is different from general Computational Thinking, as it goes into the theoretical underpinnings of efficiency, covers more data structures, and delves deeply into the implementations of those data structures.
